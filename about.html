      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="text-container-4">
        <p>
          This company was established in 2025 by its founder Sowmitri Miryala
          who saw a gap in the Governance, Risk, and Compliance sector of
          Cybersecurity. As it stands, there are hundreds of companies that
          offer similar services to what SM25 offers. The critical difference is
          in the costs of services provided. While large corporations such as
          those listed on the Fortune 500 list can afford expensive and
          comprehensive cybersecurity services, smaller companies struggle to
          maintain best practices. This is where SM25 comes in with our scaled
          pricing model. Our company recognizes the key component of
          cybersecurity is the lateral effect. All it takes is one small company
          to become compromized and then larger associated companies are placed
          at risk. SM25 priortizes community impact over profits.

      <h1>Scaled Pricing Model</h1>

      <div class="text-container-4">
        <p>
          The Scaled Pricing Model (SPM) SM25 utilizes is meant to serve as a
          transparent and accurate service that allows clients to see how much
          it will cost for the services requested. The SPM is based on a number
          of factors including but not limited to, client organization size,
          number of services requested, and amount of assets present.
          Additionally, pricing will be adjusted depending on the organization's
          sector; for example, a non-profit organization may be granted heavy
          discounts.

      <h1>Credits</h1>

      <div class="text-container-4">
        At this time, SM25 would like to provide credit to two organizations.
        First to GitHub for hosting this website free of charge. Second to
        Nikolaos Kranidiotis and his company Reconnaissance Investigation Agency
        (RIA) for providing the inspiration for both this company and website.
